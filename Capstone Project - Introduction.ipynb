One of many such projects is setting up test centers to assess patients.\nIn this project we'll be segmenting and clustering the Covid-19 Test centers in city of Toronto.\nBy plotting the test centers on the city map gives us a visual of how they are spread across this vast city with a population of 3 million. \nAt the end using Foursquare and K nearest neighbors data science concepts we find the 10 most common venues around each of the test centers. This will help in understanding what kind of businesses or amenities exist around each test center. \n\nStakeholders for the insights achieved can be many;\n    a) Government officials while planning more test centers in other neighborhoods than the present ones.\n    b) Patients to quickly identify what kind of services/amenities exist around each test center e.g Parking centers.\n    c) Businesses to take extra precautions for possible exposure due to increased influx of people in the neighborhood."
